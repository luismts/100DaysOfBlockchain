# 100 Days Of Blockchain Challege 2019 - Log 
100 Days Of Blockchain is a pledge to dedicate at least 1 hour of study or coding to blockchain development for 100 days. This initiative come from my commiment to deepen in the area and my commiment to the excutive program of blockchain from the university EOI, which I'm participating. 

## Day 1: Feb 11

### Reading about the blockchain history

**Today's Progress**: Read the first modules of the book "La Economia de Blockchain".

**Thoughts**: A lot of interesting information about the Satoshi Nakamotoa (anybody knows him yet, maybe he is reading this repo and want a meeting, who knows xD) and the blockchain world.

## Day 10: Feb 27

### Introduction to Solidity

**Today's Progress**: 

Read about:

- Data types
- Structure
- Functions
- Tools (Remix, Mist, Metamask, Truffle, Ganache)
- Special variables
- Exception
- Killing contract

**Thoughts**: This start to get serius.

## Day 11: Feb 28

### Developing smart contract

**Today's Progress**: 

Read about:

## Day 12: Feb 2

### Building my firts smart contract

**Today's Progress**: 

I was building my firts smart contracts to build a solution for a exercie proposed. I take some notes from cryptozombies platform and the resources provided.

**Thoughts**: It is really difficult to understand how smart contract can work properly. But when you got it, you are done.

## Day 13: Feb 3

### Building my firts smart contract (part 2)

**Today's Progress**: 

Continue build my smart contract. The teacher was explaning some tips about building smart contract and show us his solution for the exercie proposed (one contract, and I have like eight. OMG!). 

**Thoughts**: Now I need to learn how to involve solutions in the blockchain world. Yeah, let's start to read about use cases.
